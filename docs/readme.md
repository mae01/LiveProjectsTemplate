# Wireframes
This folder contains all source files used to create the wireframes for your project. 

Tools: 

* [Evolus Pencil](http://pencil.evolus.vn/)
* [Evolus Pencil Pretotype Plugin](https://rudylattae.github.io/evoluspencil-pretotype-template/)


Using Evolus Pencil, you can quickly create wireframes with behaviour to illustrate each feature or user story. 

Using the Pretotype plugin, you can export the wireframes and behaviour to html. 

If you export to the /docs folder in this project, you can deploy the wireframes to their own GitHub pages site. Our example wireframe is published [here](https://cmdt.github.io/LiveProjectsTemplate/#/page/start).

You can try [Axure RP](https://www.axure.com/), because it's available on the campus computers. You can compare and contrast the two. Take a look at the examples and their exports in this folder.

**Remember**

Keep interactive wireframe demos **small**. One per feature. Only model the 'happy' path (the one which gives you the preferred result)
